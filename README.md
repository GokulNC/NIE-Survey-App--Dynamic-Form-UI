*** App under construction :wink:

An app for [National Institute of Epidemiology](http://www.nie.gov.in) (NIE) for conducting surveys..

This app dynamically renders the form by receiving JSON data from the server. (Will add the server source code soon)

This app is being made for [Smart India Hackathon 2017](https://innovate.mygov.in/sih2017/)..<br>
This project falls under the [ICMR department](https://innovate.mygov.in/challenges/tablet-based-app-for-collection-of-community-health-data/).
